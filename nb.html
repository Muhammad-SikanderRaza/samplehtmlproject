            <p style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">Every morning, as the sun rises, it brings a new story to the day—just as chai (tea) brings<br> 
                warmth and comfort to my life. My day begins with the sound of a chai pan heating on<br> 
                stove, and I start thinking about how I can make it better. I still remember the day<br> 
                my father taught me to brew chai for the first time.</p>
            <p>Chai is one of the most popular beverages globally, second only to water, with May 21<br>
                designated as International Tea Day by the United Nations.</p>
            <p>The origins of tea are not precisely known, but it is thought to have originated in<br>
                northeast India, northern Myanmar, and southwest China. Evidence suggests that tea<br>
                was first discovered in China 5,000 years ago, making it one of the world’s oldest drinks.</p>
            <p>In addition to its cultural significance, tea offers health benefits, including anti-<br>
                inflammatory, antioxidant, and weight loss effects, contributing to overall wellness.</p>
            <h1>Tea culture in Pakistan</h1>
            <p>Every South Asian believes that “chai is an emotion,” and you truly feel it if you visit a<br>
                chai dhaba (teashop) after sunrise. The lively chaos, the chatter, and boys calling out<br>
                “ustaad, do cut lana” (two cuts — smaller than regular cups — of tea, please) all sync<br>
                together in a familiar harmony of emotions when you step into any popular teashop, like<br>
                the one at the University of Karachi.</p>
            <p>In pursuit of learning more about how it works, I interviewed the team at ‘Khalil Bhai<br>
                Chai’, a teashop, in Prem Gali at the University of Karachi. To my luck, I was able to<br>
                convince Abdul Qadir, Khalil Bhai's right-hand man, to answer some questions. He has<br>
                been working with Khalil Bhai, the proprietor of the teashop, since 2014.</p>
            <p>“Thanks to our warmhearted atmosphere, people from different departments and even<br>
                outside the university come to us for chai. Our specialties include doodh patti, normal<br>
                chai, Kashmiri chai, elaichi chai, coffee (with and without milk), creamy chai, and<br>
                chocolaty chai.</p>

            <p>“Doodh patti is our best-seller, and we notice that girls come in for chai even more than<br>
                boys every day,” shared Qadir, adding,” "We serve garam chai to thousands of people<br>
                and our taste is so great that customers keep coming back."
            <p>Next to the teashop is a small garden where teachers and students gather after classes<br>
                to enjoy chai together. Groups of friends from all departments and faculties come by<br>
                every day, each ordering different kinds of chai according to their taste. The dhaba also<br>
                offers parcel services and occasionally handles large orders within the university.<br>
                Business is booming, and Khalil Bhai is expanding in terms of workforce as he has hired<br>
                additional hands to manage the teashop operations.
            <p>“Tea is something that helps me relax and feel refreshed. Whether in the morning or<br>
                evening, having tea is a routine that improves my day. After tea, I feel more energetic,<br>
                and it takes away a bit of my tiredness,” said Eman Nawaz, a student from the University<br>
                of Karachi.
            <p>My household helper shared her thoughts as well: “I have chai every morning with<br>
                breakfast. It keeps me awake and helps me work better. I like my chai strong.”</p>
            <p>A friend who’s addicted to chai expressed her view: “Sharing chai with others fosters<br>
                connection and community. I like to enjoy it with my colleagues at the lunch table.”</p>
            <p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Another friend, Dina, an artist in Karachi, talked about a special bond: “My amma and I<br>
                love chai. She’s a working woman, and Saturdays are our time together since she has<br>
                the day off. We always enjoy a cup of tea together, and those moments are my favorite.<br>
                We chat about life and just enjoy each other’s company. I look forward to our<br>
                conversations at the chai table every week. It makes me happy to share that time with<br>
                 her.”</p>

            <p>Mr Irfan from Karachi shared with me his very own tradition: “Every day at 11 pm, I go<br>
                upstairs and chat with my older brother. We discuss various topics, often about the<br>
                country’s affairs, ending on a positive note with a hot cup of tea. I wait all day for this<br>
                time with him, and I cherish those moments.”</p>
            <p>Sara Ali said, “The best time of the day starts when I have chai every evening with my<br>
                husband. I share everything that happened in the day, and he does the same. It’s a time<br>
                I treasure, and I save a lot of gossip to share.”</p>
            <p>One of the most popular items served nationwide is lachha paratha (flaky, layered fried<br>
                flatbread) with chai. Even if your mother makes brinjal for dinner, don’t worry—you can<br>
                always grab chai and paratha from your favorite dhaba, and trust me, this combo tastes<br>
                better than any fancy cuisine. The tradition of chai dhabas and cafés continues to thrive<br>
                across Pakistan, offering places where family and friends can enjoy chai together. The<br>
                atmosphere at these spots is often serene, with light music playing and groups of<br>
                friends and families soaking up the simple pleasures of life. Canteens in universities,<br>
                colleges, and other institutes also offer various kinds of chai and doodh patti, wher<br>
                students gather to talk, sing, and play games together.</p>
            <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">From the bustling platforms of Rohri Station to the scenic Saif-ul-Malook Lake in<br>
                northern Pakistan, chai has been a constant companion in our lives, enriching cultural<br>
                connections and strengthening bonds of fulfillment.</p>
            <p>In Pakistani culture, professional meetings and social gatherings often involve serving<br>
                tea and often snacks, which brings people together and adds comfort and enjoyment to<br>
                shared time.</p>
            <p>The role of chai is not only limited to social gatherings as a hot beverage; it can also<br>
                help boost energy during academic exams, hectic work schedules, and serve as a<br>
                motivating factor before a job interview, a presentation, or any activity where presence<br>
                of mind and is crucial for achieving desired results.</p>

            <p>The jokes, giggles, and future plans are some of the highlights of a desi conversation<br>
                over a loaded chai table.</p>
            <p >According to the United Nations COMTRADE database on international trade, Pakistan,<br>
                as one of the world’s largest tea importers, sourced more than $600 million worth of tea<br>
                last year. Another statistic revealed that Pakistani citizens consumed a staggering $336<br>
                million worth of tea in just the first six months of 2024, according to a report published<br>
                in The News. The Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) data showed that tea costing Rs31<br>
                billion was consumed in just two months (July and August) in 2023 across the country.</p>
            <p style="font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif;">The style of making tea varies across regions. The four provinces have their own<br>
                specialties when it comes to preparing chai. For instance, Karachi is famous for doodh<br>
                patti (milky tea), while pink-coloured tea known as Kashmiri chai is popular in Punjab<br>
                and Kashmir. Black and green teas are preferred by health-conscious individuals and are<br>
                also consumed for weight loss.</p>
            <p>You already know the bliss of chai and its richness. Now, let’s share some flavorful<br>
                combos that you need to try if you are an avid chai lover.</p>
            <ul style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">
                <li>Aaloo samosa with chai</li>
                <li>Halwa puri with chai</li>
                <li>Chai and rusk</li>
                <li>Butter on bread and chai</li>
                <li>Fries with chai</li>
                <li>Nimco with chai</li>
                <li>Brownies with chai</li>
                <li>Cheese naan with chai</li>
                <li>Cheese naan with chai</li>
                <li>Andaa paratha with chai</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Pakistani culture is so vibrant, and the flavour of chai makes it even more so. Every<br>
                 household has a unique story and brews chai in different ways, creating a variety of<br>
                 colours. I love seeing how chai fascinates people every day. I am always trying to explore<br>
                 a different recipe for chai and make some memories while brewing. From beach parties<br>
                 and beating the cold weather in December to the rush at the railway stations, chai<br>
                 always comes first for everyone.</p><hr>
